# OrganizationalAI - Challenge A

This repository tracks the MLAI Hackathon 2026 submission for Challenge A, The Escalation Referee.

The current backend-development scenario is a synthetic campus student-club expense reimbursement referee. The participating club’s real manual workflow and pilot policy are pending validation.

The temporary evaluator is specified only for synthetic routine cases under the explicitly temporary `TMP-DEV-001` profile and for safely escalating incomplete, out-of-policy, or authority-exceeding synthetic cases.

## Pre-Sprint Status

This repository contains the temporary backend-development documentation, legacy planning material, and GitHub workflow templates.

The temporary profile must be replaced before any real-workflow or policy claim is made.

## Documentation

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the documentation map, ownership, and artifact status.

Read [docs/06_git_collaboration_playbook.md](docs/06_git_collaboration_playbook.md) before your first commit.

It defines our branch, commit, and pull-request rules.

## Backend development (temporary)

The backend foundation lives in [backend/](backend/) and is temporary, synthetic, and unvalidated.
Read [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for clean-clone prerequisites, setup, and quality commands.
The backend provides pure Layer 1 normalization and Layer 2 policy evaluation, plus a limited temporary API that persists immutable synthetic decision traces.
It does not make any real workflow claim.
Its operational `/health` readiness endpoint is intentionally limited to process and database status.

## Temporary UI/UX prototype

The local, backend-connected prototype is in [frontend/](frontend/). Its
journey, local launch instructions, visible boundaries, and backend handoff
question are recorded in
[docs/ui/temporary_ui_ux_prototype.md](docs/ui/temporary_ui_ux_prototype.md).

## Sprint Integrity

The team will preserve a public, truthful commit history throughout the sprint.

Public fixtures will be synthetic unless written permission explicitly allows real data.

No real payments, bank transfers, or irreversible integrations are in scope for the prototype.
